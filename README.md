# Fuel-Insights-
 ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between vehicle dimensions and fuel efficiency using Multiple Linear Regression. By analyzing real-world data, we predict highway miles per gallon (MPG) based on key vehicle features.

ðŸ“Š Dataset
Uploaded dataset for analysis includes:

Target Variable: Fuel Information.Highway MPG
Independent Variables: Dimensions (Length, Width), City MPG
ðŸŽ¯ Key Steps
Data Preprocessing â€“ Cleaning, handling outliers, and feature selection using VIF
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Heatmaps, pairplots, and 3D visualizations
Feature Scaling â€“ Standardizing numerical features
Model Training â€“ Multiple Linear Regression implementation
Evaluation â€“ Performance metrics (MSE: 2.77, RÂ²: 0.91)
ðŸ“ˆ Results
The model successfully predicts highway MPG with high accuracy (RÂ² = 0.91), demonstrating strong correlations between selected vehicle features and fuel efficiency.

ðŸš€ Conclusion
This project highlights the effectiveness of multiple linear regression in understanding fuel efficiency trends, aiding better vehicle insights.
